# This is the home page

This is content from index.md.

It uses the default Svelte layout which is specified in `_data/data.js` as
`Default.svelte`. This can be overridden just like any other 11ty front-matter
property on a per-folder or per-file basis. See [the Eleventy docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data/)
for more details.

Here's a link to [a blog post page](./blog/my-first-post).
